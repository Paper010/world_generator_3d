# 3d_world_generator
Made this for fun and just experimenting with the [macroquad]() and [world_gen]() framework.
This can probably be improved in a million different ways, and I'll leave that up to you :troll:
Yeah use it if you want for some reason.
A lot of this code is boiler-plate because I wanted to try stuff out.
